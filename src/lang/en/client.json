    "find-h": "How can I find the cheapest hotels?",
    "find-con": "To find the cheapest hotel rooms, you'll need to consider several factors that affect the price. The time of year you visit can play a major role in price, with the off-season tending to be cheaper overall. Hotels with lower star ratings are going to be more affordable as well. Additionally, you'll find cheaper options in less popular neighborhoods, which can be an easy way to save since a lot of cheap neighborhoods in popular destinations are located right next to the hot spots. Keep in mind, however, that these are general trends rather than strict rules. Hop over to the cheap hotels page for gathering budget accommodation ideas. There, you could score the best cheap hotels in the United States of America and countless more popular spots across the globe. You'll also see alternative cheap lodging options, including hostels, vacation home rentals and motels."
